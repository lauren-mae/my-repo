## What is Markdown? 

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. 

You can find out more about Markdown on [markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

## What is GitHub Flavored Markdown?

It's Markdown with some custom functionality added by Github. It is used to format prose and code across the Github site. 

You can learn how to modify Markdown for Github on [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github).

## Show me some examples

You can make text bold by encasing words in two asterisks (**), **like so**. 

You can add italicize text by encasing words in one asterisk (*), *like this*. 

But, how would you make something bold and italized? By encasing the text in three asterisks (***), ***so it looks like this***. 

To strike through text, you need to encase it in the tilde symbol (~): ~don't read this part~.

You'll notice earlier that I quoted some text from the Markdown Guide. This can be achieved by prepending the text with a greater than symbol (>).

> I've done it again here. 

You can also do this really cool thing where you call out code using backticks (``). For example, `git status`. This is an example of inline code, but you can also use backticks - three this time - to format a block of code.

``` 
Look at this awesome block of code.
Jk, it's pretty boring 
```

You can even call out colors in text, also using backticks. This is my favorite shade of pink, `#E11B8D`, but this one is nice too, `#FF98CE.` However these only appear to work in issues, pull requests, and discussions.
